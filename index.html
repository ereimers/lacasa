    <h2>Lightweight Affinity and Object Capabilities in Scala</h2>
    <p>
      LaCasa is a type system and programming model to enforce the
      object capability discipline in Scala, and to provide unique
      object references. One important application of LaCasa's type
      system is software isolation of concurrent processes. Isolation
      is important for several reasons including security and
      data-race freedom. Moreover, LaCasa's unique references enable
      efficient, by-reference message passing while guaranteeing a
      "deep-copy" semantics. This deep-copy semantics enables
      programmers to seamlessly port concurrent programs running on a
      single machine to distributed programs running on large-scale
      clusters of machines.
