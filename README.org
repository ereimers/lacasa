* LaCasa

** Building

Building LaCasa requires sbt. The build consists of two steps. The
first step consists of building and packaging the LaCasa compiler
plugin:
   : sbt 'project plugin' package

The second step consists of building and running projects like
=samples= which depend on the packaged plugin. This requires starting
sbt with the =lacasa.plugin.jar= JVM system property set to the path
of the packaged plugin:
   : sbt -Dlacasa.plugin.jar=plugin/target/scala-2.11/plugin_2.11.7-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Build and run samples:
   : > project samples
   : > run

** Testing

Once sbt has been started with the =lacasa.plugin.jar= JVM system
property set, plugin tests can be run as follows:
   : > project plugin
   : > test

The plugin tests are located in directory
=plugin/src/test/scala/lacasa/=.
